Challenge: find a way to display a lot of visual content in a non-overwhelming way

Components used:

Slide and Push Menus
=========

Fixed menus that will slide out from the sides of the page and in case of the right and left side optionally move the body.
 

Google Grid Gallery
=========

A responsive grid gallery based on the [Google Chromebook getting started](https://gweb-gettingstartedguide.appspot.com/) guide gallery. In this Blueprint we use Masonry for the grid and 3D transforms for navigating the items.
